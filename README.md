# Cython Optimization

Cython can significantly speed up parts of your application that are computationally intensive, but it also adds complexity to your build process and requires maintaining code in a language that is slightly different from Python.

Identify a part of your application that is computation-heavy. This could be a section of your recommendation algorithm, data processing, or another suitable aspect. Implement this part in Cython, and integrate it with your Django application.

Let's say the computation-heavy part is a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence to the nth number. We'll implement this in Cython for performance gains.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```
pip install cython

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

```

This will generate a .so (or .pyd on Windows) file in your app directory, which is the compiled Cython module.
